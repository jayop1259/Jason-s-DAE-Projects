            <h1>Species at Risk: An Index of Endangered Wildlife</h1>
            <p>Our planet is home to an incredible wildlife, but many species are now facing the critical threat of extinction. This website was created with the goal of raising awareness about endangered species and the urgent need for conservation efforts worldwide. From the depths of the oceans to the highest mountain ranges, wildlife around the globe is disappearing at an alarming rate due to habitat destruction, climate change, illegal poaching, and other human activities. </p>

            <p>
                This is the Red Panda ^. They live in high-altitude forests of Nepal, India, Bhutan, Myanmar, and China.
                The red panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat with a bear-like body and thick russet fur. Red pandas are very skillful and acrobatic animals that
                predominantly stay in trees. Almost 50% of the red panda's habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas. They use their
                long, bushy tails for balance and to cover themselves in winter, presumably for warmth. 
                The loss of nesting trees and bamboo is causing a decline in red panda populations across 
                much of their range because their forest home is being cleared.
